Our project focuses on the measure of percentage of body fat. In this module, we will come up with a simple, robust, accurate and precise “rule-of-thumb” method to estimate percentage of body fat.
Our project can be divided into 6 steps:

1.Data Pre-processing

2.Feature Selection

3.Model Construction & Evaluation

4.Model Diagnosis

5.Conclusions

6.Application on Shiny

## Data Folder
In the data folder, we put 2 files, one is the original dataset and the other is the cleaned up dataset.

## Code Folder
In the code folder, we put all of our code in it. It includes data cleaning, variables selection, model construction & evaluation, model diagnosis.

## Image Folder
It includes all the images and tables generated when we are running our code.

## Summary Folder
In this folder, we put 2 files. One is our jupyter notebook of report in it. The other is the complete jupyter notebook with all the code and output in it.
